## Hey, I'm GIN, a Front-end web developer.

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) as my code editor and markdown editor.
Here is my neovim config: [https://github.com/gin-18/nvim](https://github.com/gin-18/nvim).

My OS is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and window manager is [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).
You can find my dotfiles and dwm config here:
